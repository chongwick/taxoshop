# Concurrent container mutation races with size inspection

A shared dynamically sized container is mutated concurrently by one group of workers. Another group inspects the container’s memory footprint by reading its capacity or backing-storage metadata. Resizing or removal updates that metadata while the inspection reads it without synchronization. The conflicting accesses form a data race, producing inconsistent size results or sanitizer-reported failure instead of safe concurrent operation.

## Precondition

Shared mutable execution or native state is reachable by concurrent readers, writers, resetters, consumers, native calls, or cleanup paths.

## Critical operation

An operation reads, updates, publishes, consumes, validates, dereferences, or cleans up shared state while requiring coherent contents, stable lifetime, or exclusive ownership.

## Interference

Another operation concurrently writes, resets, replaces, resizes, clears, reinitializes, enters the same native context, or releases related state without the same effective synchronization, atomic publication, lifetime rule, or ownership protocol.

## Invalid assumption

A runtime guard, timing delay, one-sided atomicity, prior bounds check, borrowed reference, partial critical section, isolation boundary, or presumed exclusive cleanup is assumed to serialize all relevant accesses and preserve state or ownership.

## Failure

The overlap can produce a sanitizer-reported race, lost or contradictory state, invalid intermediate observations, out-of-bounds access, stale or freed-state use, double release, corruption, native-library failure, or a crash.

## Scope

Membership was manually restricted to the evidence listed below. This subgroup covers the single mechanism described by its member evidence.

## Search strategy

1. Search for shared mutable records, flags, pointers, containers, buffers, descriptors, registries, and native contexts reached by multiple threads; identify every reader, writer, resetter, and cleanup path.
2. Check that all related reads, writes, check-and-update sequences, and dependent fields use one complete synchronization or atomic-publication protocol, including test, debug, and representation paths.
3. Trace borrowed references, exported buffers, replaceable objects, resized storage, and native allocations to verify stable lifetime through the full use and exclusive or reference-counted cleanup.
4. Check whether locks or runtime guards are suspended or released during native calls, polling, callbacks, or blocking regions while the shared state remains in use.
5. Stress concurrent initialization, reconfiguration, reset, mutation, handoff, invocation, shutdown, and cleanup under race and memory-safety instrumentation.

## Evidence

- [#145036](../micro_taxo/gh_145036.md): A lock-free inspection reads capacity and representation while concurrent resize or clear changes related metadata and storage, showing that atomic scalar reads do not stabilize the whole representation.
